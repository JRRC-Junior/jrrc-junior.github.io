                <p>We have finally reached Emberwood Village, and the weight of what lies ahead settles heavily upon my shoulders. Two days of rest here will give us time to prepare for what promises to be the most morally complex undertaking of our adventures thus far. Both Calithea and Daven understand the gravity of what Morrigan demands – resurrection requires equivalent exchange, and the diamond worth a thousand gold pieces is merely the beginning of the price.</p>
                
                <p>Our journey to meet with the Hooded Lanterns proved uneventful, save for a brief encounter with a small group from the Amethyst Academy. A professor and his students passed us by without incident – perhaps my growing reputation precedes me, or more likely, they simply had more pressing academic pursuits than investigating a band of weary travelers.</p>

                    <strong>Equipment Note:</strong> Our recent acquisitions continue to serve us well. Calithea and Daven each sport their Cloaks of Protection, while Zeri has taken quite a liking to her Cloak of Elvenkind. The magical properties have already proven their worth in our travels.

                <p>At Shepherd's Gate, fortune smiled upon us when Daven encountered his old friend Lorick. The reunion was heartwarming, though it came with a request – his friend Aaron Grint has gone missing somewhere east of the King's Gate. I've made a mental note to keep our eyes open should our path lead us in that direction.</p>
                
                <p>Our inquiries about the Morrigan worshipper led us down a less-traveled path to a secluded clearing. The locals spoke truthfully – the journey was costly, but we found our quarry. Aegon Ghostweaver, the eccentric elven cleric of Morrigan, proved to be exactly as described. His terms were clear: the thousand-gold diamond would be consumed in the ritual, but more troubling was his requirement for a life equivalent to the one we sought to restore.</p>
                
                <p>After communing with his dark goddess, Aegon directed us to seek our "offering" somewhere between his clearing and Eckerman Mill. The very thought of what we were about to do churned my stomach, but Euphoria's life hangs in the balance.</p>
                
                <p>During our westward march, we learned of a champion of light – allegedly a paladin of the Silver Order named Ser Leandros, accompanied by squires Gregory and Alissa. They had recently saved a group of refugees, and despite what might have been genuinely noble intentions, my distrust of the Silver Order runs too deep to see past their allegiance.</p>
                
                <p>The confrontation that followed will haunt my dreams. Ser Leandros proved every bit as formidable as his reputation suggested – these paladins possess an infuriating ability to disrupt spellcasting that left me feeling helpless at crucial moments. Eventually, we managed to subdue him, though the memory of stripping and binding a man who might have been truly righteous leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.</p>

                    <strong>Moral Reflection:</strong> I tell myself we did what was necessary, but the line between necessity and evil grows thinner with each desperate choice we make. How many compromises can one's soul endure before it becomes unrecognizable?

                <p>Calithea salvaged some expedition journals from the encounter, and we collected valuable delirium worth another thousand gold from monsters the paladin had slain. At least his death – for death it surely was, regardless of our justifications – served some purpose in clearing the path for other travelers.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps the strangest moment of this entire ordeal came when Aegon requested something "strange and valuable" as an additional offering. Without hesitation, Calithea produced her prized goblin fiction – "Gobble Gobble" – that collection of rather... explicit literature she's been carrying. The cleric's eyes lit up with genuine delight, and I found myself questioning whether this macabre priest might be more eccentric than evil.</p>
                
                <p>The ritual itself defies description. Morrigan's power flowed through Aegon as life returned to Euphoria's still form. She lives again, though the resurrection has left its mark – there's a wildness in her eyes now, a permanent touch of madness that speaks to the true cost of cheating death.</p>
                
                <p>As I write this, I wonder if we saved our friend or merely prolonged her suffering. Time will tell whether the choices we made in service of friendship will prove to be our salvation or our damnation.</p>
