                <p>Finally home, and what a relief it is! The others and I have taken a well-deserved rest, and I feel the familiar surge of power that comes with deeper understanding – I've grown considerably stronger from our recent trials. The knowledge I've gained feels almost tangible, settling into my bones like warmth from a hearth.</p>
                
                <p>I've spent countless hours poring over the research I... <em>liberated</em> from our recent endeavors. The discoveries contained within these notes are absolutely fascinating, if somewhat unsettling. The author's observations about <strong>delerium crystals</strong> have completely shifted my understanding of their nature.</p>
                
                <div class="spell-reference">
                    <strong>Key Discovery:</strong> Delerium crystals aren't merely minerals – they grow like fungus! Living, breathing manifestations of magical corruption that spread through the Haze over months or even years. The implications are staggering.
                </div>
                
                <p>The research confirms what I suspected about crystal size and potency. A single large geode contains exponentially more arcane power than countless shards. It's like comparing a roaring bonfire to scattered embers. Still, those smaller pieces make excellent reagents for my alchemical work – every scrap has its purpose.</p>
                
                <p>What truly excites me is the discovery of <strong>eldritch lilies</strong> in Queen's Park Garden. These remarkable flowers actually <em>thrive</em> on contamination, using it to fuel their own growth. Combined with Oscar Yoren's aqua expurgo formula, we might finally have a reliable defense against the Haze's corruption. The man may have been our target, but his alchemical genius is undeniable.</p>
                
                <p>Speaking of dangers, we woke this morning to find a corpse by our house – apparently something large took flight from our very roof during the night. A sobering reminder that even our supposed sanctuary isn't truly safe after dark. I'm considering ward spells for the perimeter.</p>
                
                <p>We've made our choice regarding Yoren's potion formula. After much deliberation, we decided to honor our agreement with the Queen's Men for exclusive rights. The journey through the sewers was... eventful. Poor Rob's luck failed him spectacularly, and we found ourselves face-to-face with a writhing mass of mutated zombies. I'm still picking bits of rotted flesh from my robes.</p>
                
                <p>The Queen of Thieves proved as shrewd as expected, offering only half payment since we didn't eliminate Yoren as originally planned. Through some rather nerve-wracking negotiations involving wine and poison – a game I never wish to play again – we managed to secure three-quarters pay. She's sent us to follow up with Blackjack Mel in Emberwood village.</p>

                    <strong>Personal Note:</strong> I find myself oddly eager to test a <em>Fireball</em> spell against a delerium meteor. The magical resonance could prove... illuminating. Or catastrophic. Perhaps I should start with smaller experiments.
                </div>
                
                <p>Tomorrow we meet with the Hooded Lanterns to share the formula with them as well. I suspect they'll be less pleased about the Queen's Men having exclusive access, but that's a bridge we'll cross when we come to it. For now, I'm content to study these research notes by candlelight and plan our next moves.</p>
                
                <p>My spellbook feels heavier these days – not with physical weight, but with possibility. Each new spell learned is another key to unlocking the mysteries of this corrupted world.</p>
