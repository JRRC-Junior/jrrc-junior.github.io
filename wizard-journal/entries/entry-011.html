                <p>We've made camp early today, as poor Euphoria was utterly spent from yesterday's trials. The exhaustion had settled deep in her bones, and I could see the weariness etched in every line of her face. Sometimes I forget that not everyone channels the Weave as I do – physical and mental fatigue affect others far more severely.</p>
                
                <p>While she rested, we found ourselves caught between two feuding factions, each seeking our allegiance for the same bloody task. The Queen's Men approached us with silver tongues and veiled threats, asking us to "deal with" the same group of dwarven smiths that the Hooded Lanterns had mentioned. Politics in this city grow more treacherous by the day.</p>
                
                <p>After much deliberation, we've decided to throw our lot in with the Hooded Lanterns. There's something about their cause that resonates more deeply – perhaps we can guide them toward a more moderate path from within their ranks. Change, I've learned, often comes from those willing to work from the inside.</p>

                    <strong>Combat Note:</strong> Encountered <strong>Gibbering Mouthers</strong> en route to the smithy. <em>NEVER AGAIN.</em> Two of these abominations nearly overwhelmed our entire party. Their incessant babbling created zones of madness that left us stumbling and confused. Future expeditions should avoid these creatures at all costs – the tactical advantage is simply not worth the risk.

                <p>The dwarven smithy proved to be a fortress in its own right, bristling with defensive measures that spoke to years of careful preparation. Reginald, their leader, struck me as a practical man – the kind who measures trust in deeds rather than words. He's offered us access to their dispatch network and garrison facilities, but only if we can prove ourselves worthy through their weapons trade.</p>
                
                <p>Tonight we face our trial: a skeleton crew watch with only a handful of dwarves to assist us. They've made it clear that the great cannons are beyond our expertise – fair enough, as I'd rather not accidentally level half the district with unfamiliar artillery. What concerns me more is their warning about light sources. In most cities, torches and lanterns provide comfort and safety. Here, they seem to serve as beacons for whatever prowls the darkness.</p>
                
                <p>I've prepared my most reliable combat spells and made peace with the possibility of a sleepless night. If we can earn the dwarves' trust, we'll have allies with both weapons and strategic positioning. If we fail... well, I suspect we'll have made enemies of both the smiths and whatever creatures emerge from the shadows when the sun sets.</p>
