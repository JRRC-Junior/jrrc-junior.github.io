                <p>I find myself questioning how much of our business truly remains private in this city. The <strong>Queen of Thieves</strong> knows far more than she should – Daven's quest for vengeance, my own noble bloodline that I've worked so carefully to obscure. Her knowing smile when she spoke to us today left me deeply unsettled. How long has she been watching us?</p>
                
                <p>Despite my misgivings, we've accepted her commission to investigate Reed Manor and Oscar Joren. The latest shipment to the Hooded Lanterns was apparently both contaminated and woefully undersized – hardly the work of a master potionmaster. Something has clearly gone wrong, but what?</p>
                
                <div class="spell-reference">
                    <strong>Strategic Note:</strong> I proposed to the party that we consider sharing the potion recipe with all factions rather than granting exclusive rights to any single group. The moral implications of monopolizing such knowledge troubles me, and thankfully, my companions seem to agree.

                <p>As we prepared to depart, we encountered <em>Petra Lang</em> – another interested party with her own agenda. Her words were telling: "end results are what matters," she said, suggesting we should extract the knowledge by any means necessary if Oscar proves uncooperative. The convergence of so many factions around this single potionmaster cannot be coincidence.</p>
                
                <p>The offers are remarkably similar – both the Hooded Lanterns and the Queen promise 250 gold per person plus a magical item (weapon versus enchanted footwear, respectively). I suspect the <strong>Amethyst Academy</strong> may also have interests here, though I wonder if they might be orchestrating events from the shadows. The timing seems too convenient.</p>
                
                <p>Petra's parting warning about flying monsters proved prescient – we should remain vigilant during our approach to the manor.</p>
                
                <p>Our journey was eventful, though not in ways I would have preferred. A poor navigation choice led us directly into a pack of animated corpses. Discretion proved the better part of valor, and we managed to evade them entirely. Fortune smiled upon us afterward, however, as we discovered a cache of spell scrolls among some ruins: <em>Hold Person</em>, <em>Mirror Image</em>, <em>Haste</em>, and <em>Tidal Wave</em>. Quite the collection – I shall study them tonight.</p>
                
                <p>We arrived at Reed Manor as afternoon shadows grew long. The sight that greeted us was... disturbing. Two massive <strong>ogre zombies</strong> shamble about the grounds, while what appear to be Oscar's apprentices move like walking skeletons – gaunt, malnourished, barely alive. Whatever is happening here has taken a terrible toll.</p>
                
                <div class="spell-reference">
                    <strong>Alchemical Observations:</strong> I managed to observe some of the ingredients being used in the current operation: river water (likely the contaminated flows from Drakkenheim), ratfolk tails, and what I can only describe as secretions from the ogre zombies. The corruption of this once-noble craft into such vile practices speaks to desperate circumstances indeed.
                </div>
                
                <p>We may need to shelter here tonight, though the prospect fills me with dread. Something has gone terribly wrong at Reed Manor, and I fear we're walking into the heart of it. Tomorrow we shall learn the truth about Oscar Joren – and pray we're prepared for whatever that truth may be.</p>
