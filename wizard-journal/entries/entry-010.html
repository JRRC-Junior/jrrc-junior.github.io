                <p>What a relief it was to finally rest and tend to our wounds. While the others recovered, I seized the opportunity to transcribe the <strong>Haste</strong> spell into my spellbook – the arcane formulae are intricate, but I believe I've captured the essence correctly. The spell's acceleration magic will prove invaluable in future encounters.</p>
                
                <p>Daven sought solace at the old standing stones, offering prayers to <em>Danu Mother Earth</em> for his rescue and safe return. I watched him leave a precious ration as tribute – a gesture that speaks to the genuine faith these nature deities inspire. There's something profoundly moving about such ancient devotion.</p>

                    <strong>Research Note:</strong> The old druid at the shrine possesses remarkable healing abilities, curing contamination through methods that blend herbalism with divine magic. She accepts payment in gold or ingredients – particularly lichen found near crystals, or any herbs with purging or healing properties.

                <p>The druid's revelations about the missing altars were particularly intriguing. She spoke of <strong>Lugh the Sun</strong>, whose worship is considered heretical by the Sacred Flame paladins – she keeps his altar hidden within her hut. Even more fascinating was her mention of <strong>Morrigan, goddess of Death and Magic</strong>, whose shrine lies north of the city in the former Noble Hunting woods. Apparently, a priest there possesses the power of resurrection – knowledge worth remembering.</p>
                
                <p>Her stories of the city's fall painted a picture of collectors and believers who hoarded ancient relics before the end came. These ruins might contain treasures of immense value, though the Silver Order seeks to destroy such artifacts. The tension between preservation and purification continues to shape this broken world.</p>
                
                <p>Our business with the <strong>Hooded Lanterns</strong> took an interesting turn. We delivered news of Oscar Joren to the Lang siblings, but learned they're desperately short on contamination cures without the Queen's Men formula – which we've wisely chosen to keep secret. Instead, they've tasked us with brokering a deal with the <strong>Ironhelm siblings</strong>, smiths dwelling by the Crater who craft both conventional weapons and firearms. If we can prove our worth to them, the Hooded Lanterns will provide regular protection squads and garrison access in exchange for their services.</p>
                
                <p>Another test of strength awaits us, it seems. At least this time, diplomacy may prove as valuable as spellcraft.</p>
