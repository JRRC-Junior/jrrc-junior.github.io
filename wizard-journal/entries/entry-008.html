                <p>What was meant to be a simple dinner invitation to Reed Manor has turned into one of the most harrowing experiences of our adventures thus far. Our goal seemed straightforward enough – finally arrange a meeting with the elusive Oscar Yoren, who has proven remarkably difficult to encounter through conventional means.</p>
                
                <p>We hatched what I thought was a clever plan: have Ziri scout the manor grounds while we maintained our cover as dinner guests. The intelligence gathering would allow us to make informed decisions about how to proceed. Little did I know how drastically our evening would unfold.</p>
                
                <p>I must confess to a rather embarrassing discovery in the manor's library – a book titled <strong>"Gobble Gobble"</strong> which turned out to be... erotic goblin fiction. I'm not entirely sure what compelled me to examine it so thoroughly, but it has somehow found its way into my pack. <em>[Note: I have since traded this literary curiosity to Aegon in exchange for reviving Euphoria – a transaction I'm still processing emotionally.]</em></p>
                
                <div class="spell-reference">
                    <strong>Discovery Note:</strong> Behind the library's bookshelf, we uncovered a concealed passage. The books themselves were covered in dust – clearly unused despite the residents' supposed scholarly pursuits. This contradiction struck me as particularly telling about the true nature of this place.

                <p>Our reconnaissance took a dangerous turn when Ziri triggered a <em>Warding Glyph</em> just before we could reach Oscar's chambers. The magical trap's activation no doubt alerted our quarry to our presence, transforming what might have been a diplomatic encounter into something far more perilous.</p>
                
                <p>The confrontation that followed was... devastating. Despite our growing abilities, we found ourselves woefully outmatched. Poor Daven bore the brunt of the assault, and in our desperation to survive, we made the agonizing decision to retreat without him. The guilt of abandoning a companion weighs heavily on my conscience, though I pray his resourcefulness will see him through.</p>
                
                <p>Our retreat was not entirely without gain, however. Calithea managed to appropriate several volumes of Oscar's research during our hasty exit, including his personal spellbook. The contents have proven most illuminating – not only does it contain a formidable collection of spells, but the final pages detail his discoveries regarding <strong>delirium</strong> and, most crucially, a potential cure for contamination.</p>

                <p>Among Oscar's notes, I've discovered references to a particular flower found in Queen's Park Garden that possesses properties capable of combating contamination. This botanical lead may prove vital to our ongoing research into the delirium plague.</p>
                
                <p>By some miracle, our trials have strengthened us considerably – I can feel new magical pathways opening in my mind as my understanding deepens. We have reached new heights in our arcane development, though the cost has been steep.</p>
                
                <p>Relief flooded through me when Daven appeared in town ahead of us, having somehow escaped Oscar's clutches through his own cunning. His safe return is a blessing, though I fear we have made a powerful and dangerous enemy in Oscar Yoren. The wizard's resources and knowledge make him a formidable adversary, and I suspect this encounter was merely the opening move in a much larger game.</p>
                
                <p>I must study these acquired spells carefully and begin researching the contamination cure. Knowledge, as always, will be our greatest weapon in the trials ahead.</p>
